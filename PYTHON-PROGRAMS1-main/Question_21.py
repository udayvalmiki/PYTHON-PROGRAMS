Race starts at time T = 0 seconds. Robotop starts the race at T = Xth second and takes
exactly N seconds to complete one lap. On the other hand. Robocop starts the race at
T = Yth second and takes exactly M seconds to complete one lap.
Your task is to find and return an integer value, representing the least time T (in
seconds) at which these two robots meet each other again at the starting point.
